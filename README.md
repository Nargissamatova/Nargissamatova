### Hello World! 👋


I'm Nargis, a full-stack web developer with a mission to master both the front and back ends of the web.
Currently, I'm navigating the complexities of code while trying to convince my cat that JavaScript isn't a language meant for cats.
🌱 Planting the seeds of knowledge and watching them grow into beautiful applications – and, yes, occasionally watching cat videos for inspiration.
