### Hello World! 👋


I'm Nargis, a full-stack web developer with a mission to master both the front and back ends of the web.
Currently, I'm navigating the complexities of code while trying to convince my cat that JavaScript isn't a language meant for cats.
- 🌱 Constantly learning and evolving, because let's face it, the tech world changes faster than a cat chasing a laser pointer.
